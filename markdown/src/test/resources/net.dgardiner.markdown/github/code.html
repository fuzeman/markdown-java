<p>There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: <code>var example = true</code>.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:</p>

<pre><code>if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
</code></pre>

<p>GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:</p>

<pre><code>if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
</code></pre>

<p>And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
</code></pre>
