<h1>Structured documents</h1>

<p>Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a <code>#</code> to create headings. Multiple <code>##</code> in a row denote smaller heading sizes.</p>

<h3>This is a third-tier heading</h3>

<p>You can use  one <code>#</code> all the way up to <code>######</code> six for different heading sizes.</p>

<p>If you'd like to quote someone, use the &gt; character before the line:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Captain Janeway</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
